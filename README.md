# Flight-Fare-Prediction

## Problem Statement

Travelling, particularly by air, has become increasingly prevalent in recent years, with air travel gaining popularity compared to a decade ago. This trend can be attributed to several factors, including intensified competition among airlines, rising individual and household incomes, and a shift in mindset towards prioritizing time savings over the slightly higher cost of air travel.

## About
The aim of this project is to predict the flight ticket prices based on certain features. I obtained a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh)) from Kaggle for this project. 
The dataset includes the following features: 
  Airline, Date of Journey, Source, Destination, Route, Departure Time, Arrival Time, Duration, Total Stops, Additional Information, and Price.
 
 The project is divided into three parts:
    + Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    + Feature Engineering
    + Model Building and Evaluation
